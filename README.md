# Landslide_Alert_ESP32

An IoT-based early warning system designed to detect potential landslides by monitoring multiple environmental parameters. The project uses ESP32 for data processing and LoRa for long-range wireless communication. Sensor data (from 5 sensors including soil moisture, vibration, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors) is transmitted to the cloud for real-time monitoring and alert generation. When threshold limits are crossed, the system triggers local alerts and sends data to the cloud dashboard for remote access.
